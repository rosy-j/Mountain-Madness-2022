**Brief Description:** Our ambiguous project is a speed test that tests how fast you can type the words speed test. At the end we output how many words per minute you can type.

**Instructions:** 
    1. Download the project from the github page and open it in Intellij.
    2. Click Build->Build Artifacts.
    3. CLick Rebuild under the Action tab that appears. The resulting .jar should be updated. If this does not work, click Build instead to create a fresh .jar.
        It will be in <out/artifacts/Mountain_Madness_2022_jar>.
    4. After the 3-2-1 countdown we require the user to click anywhere on the window to begin typing.
